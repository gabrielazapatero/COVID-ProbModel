# COVID-ProbModel

The purpose of this project is to estimate several variables that could be appealing to analyze, concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic. 
The model will be fitted by the reported number of deaths as it is, in all likelihood, the most credible type of data reported, in comparison
with the possible unreliability of the proclaimed infected and recovered cases. From this information, the number of infected cases and the 
epidemiological parameter: basic reproductive number, R0 will be predicted. The focal point of the project will be the geographic area of the 
Madrid Autonomous Community, Spain. The model is based on Bayesian probabilistic methods implemented in R and Stan.
